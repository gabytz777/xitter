// Circles, as Twitter Circle had them: an account picks up to 150 people, and
// a post it sends to its Circle is for them alone. Replies in such a thread
// stay in the same Circle. Circle posts can't be reposted or quoted, never
// leave this instance (federation-sync.ts publicPost) and show only to the
// owner and members (circleSeen, in every post query that matters).
//
// The client still shows Circle posts, with X's "Only people in @name's
// Circle can see this post" label, and links "Edit Circle" to /i/circles,
// which shows the page here (tidy.ts). Its composer no longer offers a
// Circle, so the audience menu's Subscribers choice (super follows) becomes
// it (patchCircleComposer); choosing it sends exclusive_tweet_control_options.
